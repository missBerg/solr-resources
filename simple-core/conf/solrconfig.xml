    Here are two Request handlers defined for normal querying. If you want to know more about how to configure these see: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/RequestHandlers+and+SearchComponents+in+SolrConfig

    Below are request handlers for analysis. These aren't neccessary but useful when getting started.

<!-- Gives you a request handler where you can do field analysis. Allows you to analyse index and query time -->
  <requestHandler name="/analysis/field" 
                  startup="lazy"
                  class="solr.FieldAnalysisRequestHandler" />
<!-- Gives you a request handler where you can do document analysis. Also supports query analysis -->
  <requestHandler name="/analysis/document" 
                  class="solr.DocumentAnalysisRequestHandler" 
                  startup="lazy" />

<!-- 
    This handler simply outputs the contents of the SolrQueryRequest using the specified writer type wt. This is a useful tool to help understand what streams are available to the RequestHandlers.
